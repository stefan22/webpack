## webpack

- takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules. 
  (***wikipedia***)

- a build tool that puts all of your assets, including javascript, images, fonts and css in a  
  dependency graph. It lets you use `require()` in your source code to point to local files like images and decide how they're processed (like replacing the path with a URL or pointing to a CDN)

 ### webpack files

 - creates bundle.js
 	+ node_modules/.bin/webpack.
